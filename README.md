THE MEAL MANAGER
By: Josh Fowler, Halim Choi, Masad Ilyas, Andrew Oâ€™Brien

This application allows users to plan their meals for the week using provided criteria to choose recipes that match their input and puts it into the time slot of their choice on the calendar. Also generates random recipes for users who aren't picky.

The core features of your MVP:
Provides recipes based on user input
Creates a calendar to display weekly meal plan
    Displays schedule by day and time slot (morning, noon and night)
    Users can add their queried recipe onto their schedule

Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
    - GET requests to fetch recipe data and display them on the page
    - Takes user input to find recipes matching their inquiries


Fulfilling requirements of the project:
    - We are utilizing an API in our code which will have a large database of information to pull from and display
    - Event listeners will be employed for user input submissions, dropdowns and clicks
    - An array iteration for traversing the data received from the api
